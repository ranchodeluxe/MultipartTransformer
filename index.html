<a name="intro" class="anchor" href="#intro"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Intro</h3>

<p>Thanks for this opportunity. I only get a chance to build QGIS plugins once in awhile and it's always fun to learn new things about the API.</p>

<pre><code>$ qgis.utils.iface == GOODFUN
$ True
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="initial-approach" class="anchor" href="#initial-approach"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Approach</h3>

<p>I'm an idealist and my first approach did not take time constraints or the real world into account. Here's my original road map for the tool:</p>

<ol>
<li>The tool will take input from TOC layers or directories</li>
<li>The tool will flag input QgsVectorLayers ( of any dataProvider type ) in the related family of MuliPolygons</li>
<li>It will add flagged inputs to a QListWidget Item</li>
<li>After a user select's an item we'll walk them through an editing workflow, which will include...</li>
<li>A choice to transform multi-part polygons with one of the many existing multi-part editing tools, or... </li>
<li>A choice to fix multi-part polygons in place. By "in place" I mean we would not solve the problem by exporting all the layer's features to a new datasource. Rather, we would remove the multi-part record, break it up and append it to the existing datasource with the fields intact. </li>
<li>The tool should work with QGIS versions from 1.8 through 2.x nightly build. I wanted to do this because I don't know a single soul using version 2.x</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="hurdles" class="anchor" href="#hurdles"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hurdles</h3>

<p>I quickly discovered issues with the above road map while testing against <a href="https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe_data">InaSAFE's data repo</a>. </p>

<p>Item <code>2</code> above misses the fact that shapefiles have no concept of MultiPolygoness even after being read by OGR. This means we cannot quickly flag shapefiles by a layer-level attribute. I realized we'd have to loop through <em>all</em> layer features hunting for a multi-part geometry to flag them correctly. In combination with the size of some <a href="https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe_data/blob/master/exposure/OSM_structures_indonesia_20121005.shp">InaSAFE shapefiles</a>, it became apparent that any feature looping would have to be threaded -- both for multi-part flagging and multi-part fixing. Because of this issue i decided to abandon the idea of working with <em>all</em> QgsVectorLayer data providers and to focus exclusively on shapefiles.</p>

<p>Item <code>5</code> above was unnecessary so i abandoned it. I attempted to tackle item <code>6</code> but found myself spending too much time on the implementation because of some new API areas. I decided exporting all features was a nice fallback to get this thing done.</p>

<a name="qgis-versions-tested" class="anchor" href="#qgis-versions-tested"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>QGIS Versions Tested</h3>

<p>In the current state, the plugin works across the QGIS 1.99 to 2.0.x major release using a <a href="https://github.com/thebigspoon/MultipartTransformer/commit/9c96a03e2a5e9808687a018d1986e6ac8931532f#diff-0">not-so-smart hack</a>. It has been tested on the following platforms:</p>

<pre><code>1. Ubuntu 12.10 w/ QGIS v2.0 Nightly Build --&gt; PASS
2. Ubuntu 12.04 w/ QGIS v1.9 --&gt; PASS
3. Ubuntu 12.04 w/ QGIS v1.8 --&gt; PASS
4. Mac OSX w/ QGIS v1.8 --&gt; FAIL: Logging doesn't work among browsing weirdness
</code></pre>

<a name="plugins-xml" class="anchor" href="#plugins-xml"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plugins XML</h3>

<p>This plugin can be loaded with the QGIS Python Plugin manager by adding the <a href="http://qgisplugin.inasafe.osgeohacks.com/plugins.xml">plugins.xml URL over here</a> to the list of repositories.</p>

<a name="technical-pain-points-for-improvement" class="anchor" href="#technical-pain-points-for-improvement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Pain Points for Improvement</h3>

<p>Here's some thoughts on how the plugin code can be improved:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Multi-part fixes <em>should</em> be done in place. It's just more elegant. So this would be good to tackle.</p></li>
<li><p>Add in ability to handle all QgsVectorLayer data providers. It wouldn't take much. </p></li>
<li><p>QFileDialog.saveState() was not working and so we have a <a href="https://github.com/thebigspoon/MultipartTransformer/blob/gh-pages/MultipartTransformer/multiparttransformerdialog.py#L28-L47">jenky workaround</a>. I think this is what's wrong on the Mac OSX version</p></li>
<li><p>People like to name their shapefiles. Give them a file dialog for creating a <a href="https://github.com/thebigspoon/MultipartTransformer/blob/gh-pages/MultipartTransformer/multiparttransformer_v20.py#L124-L140">new shapefile instead of auto creating one</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining <a href="https://github.com/thebigspoon/MultipartTransformer/commit/9c96a03e2a5e9808687a018d1986e6ac8931532f#diff-0">two separate plugin APIs</a> for different QGIS versions is not smart, as the <a href="http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20">last line on the API change doc</a> points out. So either merge logic or pick one. At least it was a fun test!</p></li>
<li><p>I've heard that QThread is not best used as a parent class; that there's some type of performance hit and people should use QObject.moveToThread( QThread ) instead. So investigate that.</p></li>
